# EasyGestures

**Easy Gestures** â€” a diploma project dedicated to studying and learning sign language through gesture recognition technology. This Android application uses TensorFlow Lite to offer a seamless and interactive learning experience, making sign language accessible and engaging.
The application was developed by myself, from conceptualizing the idea to writing the code. 

I personally trained the machine learning model, capturing 20 to 30 photos for each letter of the sign language alphabet under various lighting conditions to ensure accurate gesture recognition. 
Thanks to this project, I was awarded a diploma with honors.
